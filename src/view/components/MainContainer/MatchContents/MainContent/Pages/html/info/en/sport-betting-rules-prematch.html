            <div  class="content-header-sm">Abandonments, Cancellations &amp; Postponements</div>
            <div  class="content-text">Unless otherwise stated in the Special Rules for the specific sport:
                •	Any match, event or competition which is abandoned, cancelled or otherwise prior to the full statutory time regulation, e.g. 90 minutes for football, will be considered void

            <div  class="content-header-sm">Outright Markets</div>
            <div  class="content-text">Outright markets are considered All In Run Or Not and therefore will be settled as a loss if the selection does not take part in the event. Dead Heat rules apply.

            <div  class="content-header-sm">Related Contingency</div>
            <div  class="content-text">A related contingency is a multiple bet where the outcome of one selection can contribute to the outcome of another selection, e.g. a double containing Roger Federer to win his US Open Semi-Final combined with Roger Federer to win the US Open Outright.
                •	Sky Investments Ltd reserves the right to determine which bets have related contingency
                •	Sky Investments Ltd does not accept multiple bets which have related contingency and reserves the right to void, at its discretion, multiple bets placed on related contingencies.

In instances where a bet containing related contingencies has been accepted in error Sky Investments Ltd will completely void the multiple placed and will return the stake to the customer
                •	In certain instances, Sky Investments Ltd will make available combinations of related contingencies for customers to place bets on, e.g. Mario Ballotelli to be World Cup Top Goalscorer and Italy to win the World Cup Outright

            <div  class="content-header-sm">Dead Heat Rule</div>
            <div  class="content-text">In the event of at least two competitors being declared the winner (a Dead Heat), the number of paying places remaining after clear winners are settled is divided by the number of players sharing those places. The odds for the selection are then multiplied by this number.

                e.g. In a competition with 5 paying places the top two players are settled while four players share third place. Since there are only three remaining paying places for these four players, the place odds for each player are multiplied by 0.75.
            </div>

            <div  class="content-header-sm">Push Rule (2-way Markets)</div>
            <div  class="content-text">In the event of a two competitor market resulting in a draw, a tie or exactly the number of quoted goals, points or runs and no price is offered for this conclusion the outcome is a Push. In this situation the resolution of single bets is to return stakes and for multiple bets the selection is considered a non-runner and bets will be settled on the outstanding selections.
            </div>

            <div  class="content-header-sm">Head to Head &amp; 3-way Markets</div>
            <div  class="content-text">Unless otherwise stated in the Special Rules for the specific sport:
                •	At least one competitor must finish the event or all bets are considered void

                •	If all competitors are disqualified or otherwise excluded all bets are considered void
                •	If both competitors in a head to head achieve the same result and no draw odds are offered then all bets are considered void
                •	In cases with 3 or more competitors, where 2 competitors or more achieve the same result then the dead heat rule will apply
            </div>

            <div  class="content-header-sm">Multiples</div>
            <div  class="content-text">In instances where a multiple bet includes a non-runner or a void selection, the bet will be settled on the remaining selections. Odds on the void selection will bet set to 1.00.
