    <div  class="content-header-sm">SETTLEMENT AND CANCELLATION RULES</div>
    <div  class="content-text">• If a match is cancelled before any play has taken place, then all markets are considered void unless the match is replayed within 48 hours of its initial starting time
        • If the match is tied and the official competition rules do not determine a winner; or if the competition rules determine the winner by a coin toss or drawing of lots, then all undecided markets are considered void
        • In the event of an over not being completed, all undecided markets on this specific over are considered void unless the innings has reached its natural conclusion e.g. declaration, team all out, etc.
        • If markets remain open with an incorrect score which has a significant impact on the prices, we reserve the right to void betting
