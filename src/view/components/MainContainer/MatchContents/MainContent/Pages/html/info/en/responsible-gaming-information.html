        <div  class="content-header-sm">Introduction</div>
        <div  class="content-text">Betting has to be done in moderation in the same way as eating, drinking alcohol or any other kind of consumption.
            Please follow the guidelines below
            •	Gaming is for entertainment and not to make money or replace an income from a job
            •	Only gamble the amount of money you can afford to lose
            •	Monitor how much time you spend with gambling
            •	Monitor if your gambling frequency rises after losses
            People who have problems controlling their desire to place bets or have in any way problems to control the financial risk of betting have to refrain from using this or any other sports betting system.
            If you feel that you are one of these people, we recommend that you turn to an institution that delivers professional assistance against gambling addiction.
            <strong>*Enter weblinks of institutions players can turn to in case they need help*</strong>
            In this case we also recommend you to block your account. The account can be blocked by the local support in your betting shop. They support will make sure that this process is documented and you cannot re-open a new account again.
